# ISIC2024_Skin_Cancer_Detection
Identify cancers among skin lesions from 3D photographs and metadata (Erdos Institute 2024 Deep Learning Project)

### Team Members

Madelyn Esther Cruz, Maksim Kosmakov, Sarasij Maitra, Ravi Prakash Tripathi, Jinjin Zhang

### Overview
The goal of this project is to develop image-based algorithms to identify histologically confirmed skin cancer cases with single-lesion crops from 3D total body photos (TBP). This project is inspired by the [ISIC2024_Skin_Cancer_Detection Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/isic-2024-challenge)
