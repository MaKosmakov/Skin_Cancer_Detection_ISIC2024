# ISIC2024_Skin_Cancer_Detection
Identify cancers among skin lesions from 3D photographs and metadata (Erdos Institute 2024 Deep Learning Project)

### Overview
The goal of this project is to develop image-based algorithms to identify histologically confirmed skin cancer cases with single-lesion crops from 3D total body photos (TBP).  This project is inspired by the [ISIC2024_Skin_Cancer_Detection Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/isic-2024-challenge). Skin cancer can be fatal if not diagnosed early. Dermoscopy-based AI algorithms should help clinicians in diagnosing melanoma, basal cell, and squamous cell carcinoma by aiding early diagnosis and disease prognosis. Also, determining which individuals should see a clinician in the first place is impactful. We make a combined dataset consisting of both tabular data and image data and train it using tabular modelling and various image recognition architectures.

## Stakeholders

- underserved populations lacking specialized dermatologic care
- dermatologists and primary care clinicians  
- initiatives such as [SunSmart](https://www.sunsmart.com.au/), aiding in public awareness and education
  
## KPIs

### Data Overview
- We used the [SLICE-3D dataset](https://challenge2024.isic-archive.com/) available on the Kaggle competition. The image dataset contains every lesion from a subset of thousands of patients seen between the years 2015 and 2024 across nine institutions and three continents...

### Meta Data
- [ ] EDA of Meta Data


### 3D Images
 

### Others 
- [ ] Involve Markos* to ask what type of model we may use
